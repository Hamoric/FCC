        <li class="info"><b>1881</b> -  Tesla started working at the Budapest Telephone exchange in Hungary where he was assigned the position of Chief Electrician. During his employement, he made numerous improvements to the equipment and developed an amplifier device.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1882</b> - Tesla became obsessed with solving the riddle of A.C. and suffered near fatal mental breakdown.

        <li class="info"><b>1883</b> - Tesla was sent to Strasbourg, France to repair a new D.C. lighting system installed at the German Railway company in February 1883. Howver, Tesla never recieved the compensation he was promised for the work.

        <li class="info"><b>1885</b> - In March, Tesla created the Tesla Electric Rail Company after investors approached him to develop an imprpoved arc lighting system. However, after the work was completed by Tesla, he was forced out of the company with practically nothing. The same year, Tesla quits Edison as Edison reneges on a promise to pay Tesla after Tesla successfully improved the performance of Edison's D.C. dynamo. </li>
        <li class="info"><b>1887</b> - Tesla Electric Company is formed as investors were sold on Tesla's alternating current system after he demonstrated his "Egg of Columbus". </li>
        <li class="info"><b>1888</b> - Tesla gave a speech before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on May 16th. On July 7th, Tesla sold patents for A.C. Polyphase System to George Westinghouse for $25,000 in cash, $50,000 in notes and a royalty of $2.50 per horsepower for each motor. </li>
        <li class="info"><b>1889</b> - Tesla opened a new laboratory at 175 Grand St. where he began his work with high frequency apparatus, wireless transmission, and theories on the relationship between electromagnetic radiation and light.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1890</b> - Firstly, Tesla discovered some of the first neon and fluorescent illumination. Then, he took the first x-ray photographs. However, his biggest discovery was when he discovered wireless power. Besides, this is also the year he renegotiated his contact with Westinghouse where he removed the royalties clause from his contract. He would go on to regret this for the rest of his life.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1891</b> - Tesla became an American citizen and in the same year, invented the Tesla Coil which would go on to become the basis of the World-wide Wireless System, otherwise also known as Wardenclyffe.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1892</b> - Tesla gave his "Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency" lecture in London before the institution of Electrical Engineers as well The Royal Institution of Great Britain on February 3rd and 4th respectively. He then gave the same lecture before the Societe Francaise de Physique in Paris on February 19th. In September, Tesla moved to the Hotel Gerlach after three years in the Astor House. Lastly, He was elected VP of AIEE for two consecutive years.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1893</b> - Tesla gave his "On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena" lecture before the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on February 24th and before the National Electric Light Association in St. Louis, Missouri on Match 1st. Moreover, he gave his "Mechanical and Electrical Oscillators" lecture before  the members of the International Electrical Congress at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago on August 25th.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1894</b> - Tesla is voted corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy of Belgrade on April 30th. Also, the first book about Tesla:"The inventions, researches and writings of Nikola Tesla" is written by Thomas Commerord Martin.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1895</b> - Tesla's 5th Ave Lab burns down in which all of his hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, lab data, tools and photos etc. valued at $50,000 gets destroyed.

        <li class="info"><b>1898</b> - Tesla gave his "High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-therapeutic and Other Purposes" address before a meeting of the Electro-therapeutic Association at the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences on September 13th. Furthermore, he publically demonstrated his "automation" technology at the Electrical Exposition in New York on December 8th.</li>
        <li class="info"><b>1899</b> - Tesla arrives in Colorado on May 17th to continue his high-voltage experiments that had become too large for his New York Lab.

        <li class="info"><b>1900</b> - On January 13th, Tesla left Colorado and in December, he travelled to Washington DC to discuss his wireless telegraphy system. Also, in the same year, formed the Tesla Ozone Company after he was issued a patent for a corona discharge ozone generator using charged metal plates to act on ambient air.</li>
